## ⚙️ Development Process

### 1️⃣ Designing the Terminal UI
- Created the terminal layout using HTML `<div>` elements
- Used CSS to mimic a real command-line interface
- Applied monospace fonts and dark theme for realism

### 2️⃣ Command Handling Logic
- JavaScript listens for user input
- Commands are parsed and matched using conditional logic
- Output is dynamically printed to the terminal screen

### 3️⃣ Adding Command Features
- Implemented built-in commands like `help`, `clear`, and `exit`
- Added navigation commands for projects, links, and resume
- Integrated keyboard support and command history

### 4️⃣ File Handling
- Resume is stored as a static PDF file
- `resume` command opens the PDF in a new browser tab

### 5️⃣ Making It Static
- Removed backend and API dependencies
- Converted the project into a fully static website
- Ensured it runs without any server or database
